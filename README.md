# Hamza Rizvi - Front End Assignment

This React project has been created using Vite with TypeScript. I have used the following in this project :

## Tools

- Redux and Redux/Toolkit for global state management.
- Material UI as the UI Library.
- Styled Components **integrated with Material UI** for styling.
- Formik for Form handling.
- Yup for validation of the Form fields.
- Axios for making requests.
- React-Router-Dom for routing across the app.
- Material UI Data Grid as the tabular grid for displaying records of the students.
- React-Toastify to display notifications.

# Getting Started

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HamzaRizviaa/frontend-interview-task-safepay.git

```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd <Project-Path>

npm i

```

### Run Server

```bash
$ ./run_server

```

### Run Client

```bash
npm run dev
```

## NOTE:

I created a **custom Safepay brand loader** to display during requests, but since the response time is extremely fast, the loader cannot be displayed properly. For this purpose, I have NOT used the loader, but have still left it in the project under **src > components > ui > loaders > PrimaryLoader**.
